                    <section class="post-content">
                        <p>communities they serve is that they suspect many innocent people of guilt. 
Statistical models can help officers differentiate between the innocent and the
guilty.</p>
<p>Campaign Zero, the police reform campaign proposed by Black Lives Matter activists, outlined ten ways governments can change policing regulations to meet their demands. The demand to end broken windows policing topped this list. Below, I will show an example of how machine learning algorithms can help curtail this kind of policing while keeping the number of criminals that could be caught but were allowed to walk to a minimum.</p>
<p>The idea behind broken windows policing is simple: policing all infractions, including minor ones, vigorously will reduce the quantity of serious infractions. Unfortunately,the reality of broken windows policing is that minority communities often feel the brunt of the enforcement. For example, Philandro Castile, the black man who was shot by police enforcement officers after a traffic stop, was previously accused of more than 50 traffic violations before the fatal stop. Many of these "violations" were things like improperly displaying a license plate. About half of them were dismissed outright. Constant suspicion from police may or may not have had anything to do with his death, but it definitely has a lot to do with the anger coming from the protests that followed.</p>
<p>At the same time, police officers have to be vigilant in high-crime areas to make these areas safer. Although a bulge in a jacket is going to indicate nothing illicit nine times out of ten, it may be worth stopping ten people and upsetting nine of them so that you can stop the one person who is in illegal posession of a gun. In the end, a tradeoff has to be made.</p>
<p>But perhaps if this tradeoff was more favorable (if a police officer did not have to upset nine people in order to find the one with the gun), then a high level of crime enforcement could be achieved together with a small number of annoying, and likely discriminatory stops. Perhaps, making this tradeoff more favorable could even go some ways toward reducing the anger vigorously policed communities feel toward those policing them.</p>
<p>Machine learning to the rescue! If we had data about the kind of stops that lead to arrests versus dismissals, it would be possible to use a statistical model in order to predict which suspects are completely innocent and therefore should not be stopped. One good thing that came out of the New York City's widely crticizied stop and frisk policy is exactly that. The NYPD released a dataset that included data about every stop, including when and where it occured, the reason for the stop, the characteristics of the suspect, and importantly, the outcome. In each of the twelve years for which these data are available, New Yorkers were stopped about half a million times, and nine out of ten stops were of completely innocent people.</p>
<p>The purpose of a machine learning model is to be able to predict something, as accurately as possible. In this case, I was attempting to predict whether the suspect was guilty of a crime, as assessed by the police officer at the time. Although this is far from a perfect measure of guilt, it is certainly a reasonable starting point. Unlike a traditional statistical model, a machine learning model allows many variables to be used for predictions and can assess complex relationships between the variables. This allowed me to include a great variety of variables, for example, whether the month was January, whether and what the suspect was wearing. Because the model allows for complex relationships, it takes into account that although wearing a parka in January is perfectly normal, wearing a parka in June is suspicious (it may indicate the suspect is concealing something). The most accurate model I found, as assessed by cross validation was a boosted gradient descent model of decision trees.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Below, you will find a graphical representation of the model's results. If we set the model's decision criterion to .05, we find that the model is able to identify most guilty people, but stop much fewer innocents. Specifically, at this threshold, we can reduce the total number of innocent people stopped to only 25% of the original (that means for every 100 innoocent New Yorkers that had to be stopped before, only 25 will have to be stopped if we use this tool) while still catching 76% of those who would ultimately be arrested. If we would like to make sure we catch almost all the criminals, we can decrease the threshold to .01. In this case, 59% of the original amount of innocent people would be stopped, but also 93% of those who would ultimately be arrested.</p>

<h1>Gaming the Model</h1>
<p>If this tool were implemented, it would be in a very high-stakes environment. Real criminals would have a lot to gain from understanding how it works. This specific machine learning model is more difficult to game than most because it includes interactions. It would be difficult for criminals to avoid being stopped by following simple rules like "don't wear loose clothing" because the model includes interactions between variables, as described. Nonetheless, sophisticated criminals may be able to game even a complex model like this one, perhaps through advanced knowledge of the algorithm. These kinds of criminals can still be apprehended if a stochastic element is added to the decision process. The model outputs the <em>probability</em> that somebody is guilty, rather than a decision. If people are stopped according to this probability, rather than according to a cutoff, as suggested above, gaming the model all the time would be nearly impossible. </p>
